Independent Study Project Writeup
===================================
This project contains the HTML documentation as well as PHP source & back up database for my independent study project to build a generative form application for substation readings at CEMC. It uses PHP/MySQL to generate forms based off of information stored on the database.

Note: This project was written to demonstrate the ability to build a simple web framework from the ground up and therefore attempts to use as few external libraries as possible to accomplish all tasks and therefore may "re-invent the wheel" in some places.
