                        <p>
                            For my internship with Carroll EMC, I was tasked with developing a custom web application to manage monthly 
                            readings on the various power substations owned by the co-op. Previously, CEMC relied on a large excel sheet
                            consisting of all the form data for every substation all in one giant spreadsheet. Because the spreadsheet 
                            required a laptop running excel, the readings were often conducted using pen and paper and then manually
                            re-entered into the spreadsheet upon returning to the office. By upgrading these forms into a web application,
                            I hoped to not only save our engineers a great deal of extra labor, but also allow CEMC to further its 
                            goals of becoming a paperless company.

                            Before starting on my project, I needed to determine what features were needed by the engineers in order to
                            make my application worth switching to. Using the current excel forms and input by CEMC engineers and their
                            supervisors, I came up with the following acceptance criteria.

                            <li>Store all the form information for the 24 sub stations</li>
                            <li>Maintain a stable database to store the collected readings</li>

                            <li>Be easily extendable in the event new substations are added</li>
                            <li>Be reasonably secure</li>

                            My first task was coming up with a means of storing the form information for the individual substations. With 24
                            substations, each with their own unique form fields, it seemed impractical to hard code individual pages for each
                            substation. While 24 form pages is not an outrageous amount to code, bringing up past form results for each substation
                            would have required a great deal more conditional logic than necessary. I also wanted to be sure that if another
                            substation was built, it could be easily added to the application without considerable effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Knowing that I would need a database in place to serve as persistent storage for the forms themselves, I decided to
                            store the form information for the various substations in the database as well. For this purpose, I decided to use
                            MySQL because it is both open source, and offers a strong relational database architecture. I began by finding the 
                            lowest common denominator between the substations. All substations have a name based on their relative location. In 
                            addition, each substation is made up of regulators and breakers, whose attributes vary. To represent these models I 
                            created the following relationship schemas:

                            By this point I knew that the application needed to be compatible with any device. Normally the twitter
                            bootstrap would achieve this goal nicely; however, due to the very custom nature of the application, I
                            decided to write my own stylesheets for the program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main problem of creating universally accessable layouts is that most developers wait until the last
                            minute to consider how their layout will look on mobile devices. I knew from the beginning that my 
                            application would mostly be viewed from an iPad. I realized immediately that I would need to use as 
                            absolute positioning and fixed dimension elements in my design as possible. When styling the 
                            application, I used percentages to specify widths wherever possible. This allowed me to keep my core 
                            layout identical between devices; however, my font sizes, borders, and form sizes did not scale well
                            between devices. To remedy this, I used em widths to define these style rules. Unfortunately, there 
                            are a few elements (like the select element) that would not appear correctly unless I specified a set
                            height. For these values, I simply guessed and checked between devices until I was satisfied with the 
                            results.

                            Because I designed the application to generate forms dynamically based off of a database, All
                            of the form attributes can be changed by altering the database information. A substation structure
                            can be easily modified and with a few basic SQL commands, breakers and regulators can be added or
                            removed as needed. New substations can also be created in the same way. The new changes are visible
                            the next time a user accesses the application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I eventually plan on adding an extra admin interface to allow this new additions and edits to be
                            conducted visually without the need of any prior SQL knowledge. This feature could easily be added
                            with a few insert commands; however, the priority for implementing these features is fairly low.

                            The final concern for the application was insuring that it was reasonably secure from unauthorized access.
                            To accomplish this, I first made sure that all of my queries were called only after using mysql_real_escape_string()
                            and used the mysqli library for any update / insertion operations. By using these functions, my code is reasonably 
                            secure from basic sql injection. While the code is most likely not bullet proof, the data itself is not sensitive
                            and the mysql server is independent of all other CEMC database servers. In addition, the currenly implemented application's
                            mysql server is set to back up automatically in case of a catastrophic failure or intrusion. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I needed the ability for my users to have individual logins for the program. Because the list
                            of users was reasonably small I did not bother to set up systems for creating new users from inside the application; however,
                            I do plan on implementing this feature eventually. I set up user passwords with the standard salted hash encryption for storage,
                            and set a system in place to allow users to change their passwords from inside the application. Currently the application
                            does not track which user created the reading because this was not a priority feature; however this functionality can easily
                            be added by adding a creator field to the station read table.
